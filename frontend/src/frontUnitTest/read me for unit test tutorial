To run this test, you need to be in the frontend folder, not src or frontUnitTest folder.
This is due to the importance of the .json that those two folders lack.
After you're in frontend folder, just run npm test in terminal.


If npm test doesn't work, consider running these inside the frontend folder to fix:
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom
