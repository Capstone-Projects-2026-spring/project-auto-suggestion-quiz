when testing, type 'pytest test_back.py' in temrinal to initiate test
I've made an example down there in test_back.py that is just 1 + 1, which is true.

If you plan to for some reason make more .pys to test methods in the backend, always start the file with "test_"

I've made a basic example to check if it's true: 1 + 1 == 2 (yes)

Also create the coverage report with: 
'pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html test_back.py'
