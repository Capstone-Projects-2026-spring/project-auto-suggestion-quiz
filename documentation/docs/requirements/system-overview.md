# System Overview

AutoSuggestion Quiz is a web-based educational application that helps students develop critical thinking skills when working with AI-generated code commonly found in modern IDEs. Teachers create and upload quizzes, and students can write and run code directly in the platform while answering by selecting from multiple-choice code suggestions. After submission, teachers can score responses and provide feedback. This format encourages students to question AI-generated code and builds confidence in tackling complex programming problems.
