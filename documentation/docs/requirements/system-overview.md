The application allows users to practice academic or technical topics by receiving suggested quiz questions based on selected subjects, difficulty levels, and user performance. By dynamically generating quizzes instead of relying solely on static question banks, the system provides a more personalized and efficient study experience.
Users can take quizzes, receive immediate feedback and scores, and review their performance history over time. The system aims to support active learning, improve knowledge retention, and reduce the effort required to create or search for practice materials.
